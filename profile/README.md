# Washington Business Week

>Educating, Inspiring, and Impacting the Leaders of Tomorrow

Washington Business Week (WBW) creates a hands-on experiential environment to educate, empower and encourage a diverse population of high school students to recognize and achieve their potential. Business leaders, educators, high school students, and community volunteers teach and inspire one another to be responsible employees, employers and citizens.

WBW‚Äôs programs place high school students in a dynamic simulation where they compete as industry professionals, sharpen communication skills, and face real-world challenges. With the guidance of a mentor from the business community, students gain a competitive edge in college preparation, workplace readiness, and overall life success. If you‚Äôre a current high school student (grade 9-12), this is the place to ignite your potential.

Week-long residential programs are held at university and college campuses in the summer and focus on the areas of business, healthcare, and technology. Business Week programs are also offered in eleven states and internationally in Poland and Italy. In-school programs are offered in rural areas throughout Washington state during the academic year including Centralia, Aberdeen, Omak/Okanagan, Hoquiam, and Willapa. At each program, students undertake hands-on projects providing them the opportunity to operate a business and create a new product.
